# Future Sales Prediction for Advertising Dataset using Linear Regression

This repository provides a sales prediction model using linear regression for an advertising dataset. The model aims to predict sales based on various advertising channels, such as TV, radio, and newspaper.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of historical data on advertising expenditures and corresponding sales for different channels. The dataset includes the following columns:

- TV: Advertising budget for TV in thousands of dollars.
- Radio: Advertising budget for radio in thousands of dollars.
- Newspaper: Advertising budget for newspaper in thousands of dollars.
- Sales: Sales in thousands of units.

The dataset is available in the file `Advertising.csv`.

## Model

Linear regression is a statistical approach used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (sales) and one or more independent variables (TV, radio, and newspaper). This model assumes a linear relationship between the variables.

In this repository, we have implemented a linear regression model using Python and the scikit-learn library. The code for training and evaluating the model can be found in the `Future Sales Prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

## Getting Started

To get started with the sales prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, install it using `pip install jupyter`.
4. Open the `Future Sales Prediction.ipynb` Notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
5. Follow the instructions in the Notebook to train and evaluate the linear regression model.
6. Once trained, you can use the model to make predictions on new advertising data.

## Results

After training the linear regression model on the advertising dataset, you will be able to evaluate its performance and make predictions. The Notebook provides visualizations and metrics to assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness in predicting sales based on advertising budgets.
